# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

BedrockAdder is a beta Paper plugin plus Geyser extension that makes ItemsAdder content (items, 3D models, blocks, armor, furniture, font images, GUI backgrounds) visible to Bedrock players. It converts locally on the server; there is no hosted converter. Licensed AGPL-3.0-only.

## Build and test

```
./gradlew build                      # all modules + tests; produces the two jars below
./gradlew :common:test               # converter tests (the only module with tests)
./gradlew :common:test --tests "dev.bedrockadder.common.convert.FontConverterTest"
./gradlew :common:test --tests "*ConverterTest.legacyCustomModelDataItem"
```

- `paper` compiles against `libs/ItemsAdder-*.jar` (`compileOnly` fileTree). The jar is a paid plugin: git-ignored, never commit or redistribute it. Without it only `common` and `geyser-extension` build.
- No Java toolchain is configured: any JDK 21+ builds, `options.release = 21`.
- Outputs:
  - `paper/build/libs/BedrockAdder-<version>.jar`, the server plugin. Its `processResources` embeds the extension shadow jar as `BedrockAdderExtension.jar`.
  - `geyser-extension/build/libs/BedrockAdderExtension-<version>.jar`, with Gson relocated.
- `ConverterTest` also writes the unpacked output to `common/build/test-output/` for manual inspection.

## Architecture

Three Gradle modules. Data flows plugin → bundle → extension:

1. **`paper`**
   - `ItemsAdderListener` receives the generated pack from `ItemsAdderPackCompressedEvent`. When ItemsAdder doesn't rebuild an unchanged pack, it falls back to reading `ItemsAdder/output/generated.zip` 5 s after `FIRST_LOAD`.
   - `IaRegistryReader` snapshots the ItemsAdder registry into `IaItem`/`IaBlock` records on the server thread.
   - `ConversionService` converts on a single background thread and writes a **bundle** to `plugins/BedrockAdder/bundle/`. A `Deployer` then delivers it: `LocalGeyserDeployer` (Geyser-Spigot on the same server; also installs the embedded extension jar), `FolderDeployer` or `HttpDeployer`.
2. **`common`** is the converter and has no Bukkit or Geyser dependency.
   - `Converter.convert(ConversionInput, Options, packName)` → `Bundle` (item/block specs) + `.mcpack` + Geyser v2 mappings JSON (`MappingWriter`, export only).
   - `JavaPack` → `ModelResolver` → `ItemConverter` / `BlockConverter` / `ArmorConverter` / `FontConverter` → `BedrockPack`.
3. **`geyser-extension`**
   - On `GeyserPreInitializeEvent` it syncs per `config.properties` (`LOCAL`/`FOLDER`/`HTTP`), copies `bundle/` to `active/` and loads it.
   - It then registers items via the API (`GeyserDefineCustomItemsEvent`), blocks with `registerOverride(javaState, ...)`, and the pack from `active/`.

Furniture is runtime, not conversion: `FurnitureMirror` (paper) spawns a non-persistent, invisible marker armor stand per ItemsAdder `item_display`. The stand is `setVisibleByDefault(false)` and shown only to Bedrock players (`BedrockPlayers`: Floodgate, else Geyser API), and wears the display's item. The item's attachable has a `furniture` pose used when `q.owner_identifier == 'minecraft:armor_stand'`. Geyser's API cannot tell an extension which item a display entity shows, hence this design.

## Invariants that are easy to break

- **Bump `Converter.CONVERTER_VERSION` whenever converter output changes.** It is part of the bundle hash and stored in the bundle. Unchanged hashes skip conversion, and the extension ignores bundles from a different converter version.
- **Geyser loads custom content only at startup.** Every content change needs conversion then a restart. Never overwrite a pack Geyser is serving: it hashes the file once, which is why the extension serves from `active/`, not `bundle/`.
- **ItemsAdder's generated pack is protected.** `JavaPack` and `Textures` undo this; keep that in mind before assuming plain paths:
  - real item definitions live in `ia_overlay_*` dirs (overlays for the newest pack format are applied);
  - models reference atlas sprite aliases like `ia:18`, resolved via `atlases/*.json` `single` sources;
  - PNGs have broken zlib checksums, repaired in `Textures.repairPng`;
  - zip local headers are scrambled, so read zips from disk with `ZipFile` (`JavaPack.readZip(Path)`), not `ZipInputStream`.
- **The ItemsAdder API jar is obfuscated without generics or inner-class metadata.** Cast elements of `getNamespacedIdsInRegistry()`. Use `var` for `PackEntry`, and `String.valueOf(event.getCause())` instead of naming `ItemsAdderLoadDataEvent.Cause`.
- **Always use `Locale.ROOT` for case conversion.** A Turkish JVM locale turns `i` into `İ` (ItemsAdder itself breaks this way; servers need `-Duser.language=en`).
- **Bedrock identifiers must start with a letter.** `ResourceId.flat()` strips ItemsAdder's leading `_` (namespace `_iainternal`); the client refused to join otherwise.
- **3D attachables** need the root bone `binding` (`ITEM_BINDING` in `GeometryConverter`) or models float at the player origin. Java→Bedrock geometry mirrors x (`origin = [-to.x + 8, from.y, from.z - 8]`).

## Fonts and GUI backgrounds

- **Glyph sheets.** `FontConverter` maps `minecraft:default` bitmap glyphs in the private-use range to Bedrock `font/glyph_XX.png` sheets. Bedrock draws each 16×16-grid cell at a fixed size, so one cell represents `fontCellUnits` Java font pixels (default 32) and the Java `height`/`ascent` place the glyph inside it.
- **Offsets.** Positive offsets become invisible glyphs whose width is set by an alpha-1 pixel; negative offsets are impossible on Bedrock.
- **GUI backgrounds.** Glyphs with height ≥ 64 are GUI backgrounds: invisible in the sheet. `ChestUiWriter` writes `ui/chest_screen.json` that adds them to the classic chest `root_panel` with `"visible": "(not ($atext - '<glyph>' = $atext))"`, where `$atext` is `$container_title`. It also redraws the title above them. The `requires` + `ignored` variant did not work in game.
- **Coordinate constants.** The constants in `ChestUiWriter` (Java title at (8,6), Bedrock slots 4 px lower) were verified pixel-exact against screenshots.

## Testing in game

- **Unit tests** cover the converter with fixture packs that mirror real ItemsAdder output (`ItemsAdderPackLayoutTest`). Several bugs only showed up against a real ItemsAdder pack and real Bedrock client, so verify visual changes in game.
- **Local test server.** `test/` is a git-ignored Leaf test server, started with `start.bat`; `test_ss/` holds Java vs Bedrock comparison screenshots. Don't replace the plugin jar while that server is running: ask the user to stop it, then copy `paper/build/libs/BedrockAdder-*.jar` into `test/plugins/`. Two restarts are needed for converter changes: convert, then Geyser load.
- **Reference files.** Vanilla Bedrock UI JSON can be read for reference from the installed client's `data/resource_packs/vanilla/__brarchive/ui.brarchive`, which is an uncompressed archive. Do not copy it into the pack.
